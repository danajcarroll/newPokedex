# Pokédex

An app for users to browse Pokémon using the PokéAPI.

## Project Status

This app is currently in the works!

## Description

In this app I'll be using the PokéAPI to fetch all the Pokémon details. Users will be able to see the top 3 featured Pokémon of the day, add Pokémon to their favourites, and browse Pokémon by type.

### Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (async/await functions)
- PokéAPI
- Node.js (node express, node cron)
- Splide.js

### Challenges

Asynchronous Functions - So far these are proving to be extremely handy to fetch information. It has been a learning curve understanding how to continue to fetch information to create a new Pokémon object, but I'm glad that I'm learning about these functions!

Node.js - This would be my first time using Node in an application! I'd like to schedule a job to only refresh the Pokémon of the day once a day, and after some research I found that node-cron would be a good way to do that. I've thrown myself into learning Node and I'm excited to learn more. I'm also using Node Express to host my static files on another server, it's interesting to start the server by using the terminal, and I'm seeing how this can be so useful in terms of client and server side programming.
